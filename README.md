# Android Studio Exercise: Click Animals
This is a simple Android application built with Java in Android Studio. The exercise involves displaying a few animal images on the screen, and when the user clicks an animal, the app updates a central text message and changes the color of the text and a button. A "clear text" button resets the text and colors to their initial state.
